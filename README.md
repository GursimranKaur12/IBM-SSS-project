üìò Title & Context

Project Title: Predictive Insights into Customer ‚Äî Telecom Case Study

The document is a project report demonstrating practical use of IBM SPSS Modeler for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis of telecom customer data ‚Äî aimed at deriving predictive insights and improving customer understanding.


---

üß© Core Topic: Unit of Analysis

The central concept covered is ‚ÄúUnit of Analysis‚Äù ‚Äî which refers to the level at which data is grouped and analyzed in SPSS.

Definition

The Unit of Analysis determines how the dataset is organized for analysis ‚Äî whether at the customer, transaction, or product level.

It is used to:

Remove duplicate rows, ensuring data integrity.

Summarize multiple rows into a single record per group (aggregated view).

Create binary fields (0/1) to label or filter data (e.g., Yes/No flags).



---

üß† Learning Outcomes

The student learned to:

Eliminate duplicate records to maintain clean datasets.

Use aggregation to compute total or average values (e.g., revenue).

Apply flag fields for binary classification or filtering.

Retain only valid and relevant records for analysis.



---

‚öô Tools Used

IBM SPSS Modeler (a visual data mining and predictive analytics platform)

Excel dataset (used as input data source)



---

ü™ú Step-by-Step Working Procedure

Step 1: Import Dataset

Open IBM SPSS Modeler.

From the Source tab, drag an Excel Node to the canvas.

Import the Excel dataset into this node (the telecom customer data).


Purpose: Load the raw data for further processing.


---

Step 2: Remove Duplicates

Add a Record Ops Node and connect it to the Excel Node.

Choose Select Distinct to remove duplicate entries.

Set all fields as key values to ensure uniqueness.


Purpose: Ensure each record represents a unique customer.


---

Step 3: Validate Duplicate Removal

Connect a Table Node to the Record Ops Node.

Run it to verify the output.

Confirm that only unique records remain.


Purpose: Validate data cleaning effectiveness.


---

Step 4: Import Additional Data

Add a Var File Node to import a flat file (another data source).

Connect a Table Node to view the loaded data.


Purpose: Merge or use external data for richer analysis.


---

Step 5: Aggregate Data

Connect a Record Ops Node to an Aggregate Node.

Select Revenue as the key field.

Apply Sum and Mean functions to compute total and average revenue.


Purpose: Summarize revenue performance across customers or products.


---

Step 6: Review Aggregated Output

Connect a Table Node to the Aggregate Node.

Run to view summarized results.

Verify total and average revenue values.



---

Step 7: Define Field Types

Add a Type Node from the Field Ops palette.

Connect it to the previous node.

Use it to assign correct data types (numeric, string, etc.).


Purpose: Ensure data fields are correctly formatted for modeling.


---

Step 8: Create Binary Flags

Add a Set to Flag Node from Field Ops.

Connect it to the Type Node.

Convert product or categorical values into Yes/No (0/1) fields.


Purpose: Enable filtering or classification for predictive models.


---

Step 9: Display Final Output

Add a final Table Node (from Output category).

Run the complete stream to display cleaned, aggregated, and flagged data.


Purpose: Obtain a ready-to-use dataset for further predictive analysis.


---

üìä Final Output Summary

After completing all steps, the final dataset includes:

Unique customer records

Aggregated revenue values

Flag fields (binary indicators)

Properly typed fields ready for analytics



---

üß© Overall Objective

The report focuses on preparing telecom customer data for predictive analysis ‚Äî specifically for customer retention and behavior insights.
By applying SPSS Modeler nodes effectively, the student demonstrates:

Data cleaning (duplicate removal)

Aggregation (revenue metrics)

Data transformation (flagging)

Preparing structured data for future modeling (e.g., churn prediction)
